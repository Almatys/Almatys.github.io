          <h2>The Evolution of Game Narratives: 
            How Video Games Have Changed Storytelling</h2>
          <p>Video games have transformed storytelling 
            through interactivity and immersion, allowing players 
            to influence outcomes. Titles like The Last of Us and Detroit: 
            Become Human showcase this shift, while games like Minecraft 
            use emergent storytelling. As VR and AR develop, video games 
            will further redefine narrative techniques, highlighting 
            their unique storytelling potential.</p>

          <h2>Tapped Out</h2>
          <p>In this gripping new podcast series, 
            we dive deep into the aftermath of Hurricane Helene 
            and its impact on Virginia Tech's campus water supply. 
            "Tapped Out" explores the boil water advisory issued 
            by the university, its ripple effects on students, staff, 
            and the local community, and the science, politics, and 
            human stories behind the disaster recovery process. 
            From campus-wide water shortages to the challenges of 
            restoring basic services in the wake of a natural disaster,
